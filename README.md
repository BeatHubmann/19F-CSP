## Course synopsis

Computer simulation methods in statistical physics:

- Classical Monte-Carlo-simulations: finite-size scaling, cluster algorithms, histogram-methods, renormalization group. Application to Boltzmann machines. Simulation of non-equilibrium systems.

- Molecular dynamics simulations: long range interactions, Ewald summation, discrete elements, parallelization.
